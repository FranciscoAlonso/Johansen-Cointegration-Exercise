    "I'm trying to reproduce the Example 3.2 from \"Likelihood-based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models\" by SÃ¸ren Johansen. The example proposes the following processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{1t} = \\sum_{i=1}^t \\sum_{j=1}^i \\epsilon_{1j} + \\sum_{i=1}^t \\epsilon_{2i}$  \n",

    "\n",
    "$X_{3t} = c\\sum_{i=1}^t \\epsilon_{2i} + \\epsilon_{4t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $X_{1t}$ and $X_{2t}$ are $I(2)$ processes and $X_{3t}$ is an $I(1)$ concluding that $(a, -1, 0)$ is a cointegrating vector that brings the order of the process from 2 to 1 and $[ac, -c, -(a-b)]$ brings the order from 2 to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "I haven't been able to get similar cointegrating vectors from the Johansen test in Python, also, these processes are supposed to be non-stationary but the ADF Test suggests the rejection of the null hypothesis. As you can see I have some confusion in the matter; below you can find links to the code:\n",
